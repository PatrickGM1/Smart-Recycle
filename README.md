# 🌱 Smart-Recycle: Revolutionizing Everyday Recycling  

Smart-Recycle is an innovative project designed to make recycling an effortless and rewarding part of daily life. Our vision is to promote sustainable habits through an incentive-based program that benefits both individuals and eco-conscious companies.  

## ♻️ How It Works  
By utilizing our **smart recycling bins**, users can **earn points** for properly disposing of recyclables. These points can then be **redeemed for exclusive discounts and coupons** provided by our affiliated eco-friendly businesses.  

This approach:  
✅ Encourages active participation in recycling  
✅ Rewards users for making environmentally responsible choices  
✅ Helps partner companies enhance their **"green" reputation**  

## 🏆 Award-Winning Innovation  
In recognition of its impact and technological innovation, **Smart-Recycle was awarded the Gold Medal in the Computer Science category at the International Greenwich Olympiad in July 2022.**  

This prestigious honor highlights the project’s potential to drive meaningful environmental change through smart technology.
